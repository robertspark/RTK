Work in progress for an RTK Base and Rover Station using a Raspberry Pi, along with a UM980 RTK GNSS Reciever, and a Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer chip.

The purpose is to broadcast RTK corrections to either an NTRIP Caster (RTK2GO), or create a locale NTRIP CAster, which could be accessed from a second similar device to act as a survey rover.

The RTK Corrections will be:
RTCM1005 30
RTCM1033 30
RTCM1077 1
RTCM1087 1
RTCM1097 1
RTCM1107 1
